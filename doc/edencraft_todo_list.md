# ToDo List EdenCraft Engine

## Versions system
The version system works as follows: \[dev/alpha/beta/rc/release\]-Major.Minor.Fix
The prefix tag gives the distribution stage, whereas the major version indicates the progress stage. Minor version indicates the number of modifications done on a major version, and the fix is the number of fix patches applied on the same major version.

### Dev
Dev version won't be used at all for now. Eventually, it will be used for nightly build in the future.

### Alpha
Alpha is the first stage of distribution of the software. It is a version to test functionalities without any guarantee it works. Some of the alpha releases might be public, but most of them shall be private.

### Beta
Beta is the second stage of distribution and concerns a working but incomplete software. It means that it is supposed to works, but not all the features of the release have been implemented yet. Beta versions can be public, as well as private.

### Release Candidate (aka. RC)
A release candidate is a proposal for releasing a version of the software. Then, no new features will be added to. The only possible modifications are bug fixes. The version is delivered and considered as near-stability.

### Release
Release is the final stage  of the software. A release is stable and completed. There is no new features and theoretically, no new patches in this version. It does not mean, there will be no new versions of the software. It means, that, this version is achieved.

## Alpha guideline
For an alpha version, all code needs to be commented obviously. However, it is not mandatory to have all unit tests. It is only supposed to compile and run.
